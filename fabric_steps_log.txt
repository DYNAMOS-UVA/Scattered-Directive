FABRIC log

-originally tried on the default version of the jupyter FABRIC
-11/09 tried "bleeding edge" version 
	(it looks like it works, but the execution never ends...) (takes ~5 min) (then goes to the after-boot-config and there is getting stuck...)
	(I think it was more than 1:30h and it still is stuck; I willinterrupt)
	TODO: try different parameters on the slice.submit
- nodes seem to work, I get output from all the nodes (via the execute and the list_nodes)
- there might be some issue with the Tokyo nodes... (others seem ok)

notebook 2 seems ok 

Notebook 3 
after some tricks to get all the ips (I had to do the last one manually, because otherwise it would get stuck) 
	but it seemed to finish ok with this hack 


nodebook 4:
there were some warnings 
but at the end seems reasonable. I assume it is OK 

notebook 5:
had to assign manually the agents and the thirdparties variables
but worked otherwise.

TODO: 
- Now to make sure it makes sense
- find a way to monitor k8s 
	- probably will need to do SSH and then k9s 
	- read thesis in case it has info on it 
- find a way to run test request (maybe there is something on his repo?)
