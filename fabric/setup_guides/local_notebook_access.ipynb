    "Mainly you need to download a token from https://cm.fabric-testbed.net/ (according to the above) and save it on a file. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then you need to put it in an env variable for your jupyter environment e.g.: FABRIC_TOKEN_LOCATION=C:\\Users\\alkou\\FABRIC_tokens\\id_token.json\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you should be able to use the fablib from your machine. \n",
    "\n",
    "To use SSH refer to the ssh_setup.ipynb file. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: I think this method will require often renewal of the token ids which might be a bit annoying but I don't know of any better alternatives. \n"
